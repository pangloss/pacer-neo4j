    # Please note that Pacer turns on Neo4j's checkElementsInTransaction
    # feature by default. For some sort of performance improvement at
    # the expense of an odd consistency model within transactions that
    # require considerable more complexity in client code, you can use
    # `graph.setCheckElementsInTransaction(false)` to disable the
    # feature.
